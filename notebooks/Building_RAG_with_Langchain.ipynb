Introduction  \\n \\nA teaching learning support system (TLSS) is a computer -based learning and teaching \\nsystem that provides an effective way to supplement the educational instruction \\nprovided in the classr oom. It helps to provide additional help and resources to learners \\nin the form of simulations, digital books, videos and other digital content. TLSS also \\nfocuses on motivating and engaging learners, as well as assessing the understanding \\nand progress of le arners. A Teaching -Learning Support System (TLSS) refers to a set \\nof tools and resources that are designed to support the teaching and learning process.  \\nTeaching and learning support systems are designed to enhance and support the \\nteaching and learning pro cess. The requirements for a teaching and learning support \\nsystem can vary depending on the specific needs of the educational institution and the \\nlearners, but some common requirements include accessibility, user -friendly interface, \\nmultimodal delivery, co ntent management, interactivity, assessment and feedback, \\nsecurity and privacy, compatibility, technical support. By meeting these requirements, \\nteaching and learning support systems can provide a more effective and engaging \\nlearning experience for student s, and better support for instructors in their teaching \\nefforts.  \\nUsing technology in the teaching learning provides students with access to countless \\nonline  resources, encouraging them to carry out research and therefore become more \\nindependent. It  also si mplifies learning by making concepts more digestible.  \\nThe name “Askuala” indicates that old incorrect calling of modern education or school. \\nWe use this title for the purpose of making the system familiar to the user.  \\n \\n1.1.

Background  of the organization  \\n \\nModern higher education in Ethiopia began with the founding of the Addis Ababa \\nUniversity  on March 20, 1950. When formal lectures started in the univ ersity on \\nDecember 11, 1950, the  Faculty of Science, one of the only two Faculties then, had only \\ntwo departments or sections,  known as Section A and Section B. In Section A, students \\nwere given basic training in  Engineering,  which  would  enable  them  to go abroad  to \\nspecialize  in one of the  many  branches  of Engineering, whereas those in Section B were \\nprepared for Medical School as well as for  further  studies in Biology  and allied fields.  \\n \\nWhen the Haile Selassie I University was established in 1961, the Fac ulty of Science \\nwas reorganized  into five teaching  departments,  all offering  B.Sc.  degree  programs.  \\nThese  were  the departments  of: Biology,  Chemistry,  Geology,  Mathematics,  and \\nPhysics.  A Forestry  Department,  the Natural  History  Museum  and the National  Her \\nbarium  were  established  a little later, while a statistical training center was opened in the \\ndepartment of Mathematics, center  that developed into a full -fledged department of \\nStatistics in the  early  1970s.  \\nCollege of Natural and Computational Sciences i s one of the natural science colleges \\nfrom  Addis Ababa University. The College of Natural and Computational Sciences in \\nits more than  50 years of establishment has gone through various stages of development. \\nCurrently, the  College comprises eight departmen ts, two schools, two institutes, and \\nthree multidisciplinary  programs  offering  undergraduate  and postgraduate  degrees.  \\n(cns, 2023)', metadata={'source': '../data/Final Askuala1$2.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n",

Statement of the problem  \\n \\nAlthough traditional chalk and board educational system is widely used all over the world, acting \\nlike the main teaching and learning system, it is faces several challenges that makes it unfortunate \\nto provide a successful knowledge exchange between teache rs and students. Problems like a \\nlimitation to access educational resources due to geographical restrictions, lack of technology and \\nhigh cost of learning equipment, material may not up to date with the latest development and \\ntechnologies in the industry.  Student learns differently, some prefer to learn slowly and explore \\ndifferent learning  methods , while others use huge resource and references to understand thei r \\nsyllabubs, helping all of them fully retain information is our priority.  In traditional chalk and board \\neducational  system,  students  must  adapt  to the pace of the class  or be left behind. Students  learn  \\nbetter  and feel more comfortable learning in an environment of their preference. This is not always  \\npossible  in a classroom  with a physical  space  restriction.  After  the classroom  teaching  process,  \\nstudent need support in terms of accessi ng learning materials like  reference books, exam  questions  \\nand  discussion  with their instructors  without time and  place  restriction.  \\n1.3. Objectives  of the Project  \\n \\nProject objectives state the aim of a project. Some projects have only one project \\nobjective,  while others  own several  objectives  that could  be completed  at various  times  \\nduring  the project.

Process modeling \\ncan make it easier to  analyze and understand work flow by dividing the process into \\nsmaller and manageable steps.   \\n \\n1.8.2.2  Development  approach  \\nSystem development approach is a methodology for systematically organizing the best \\nways  to develop  systems  efficiently.   \\nThe methodology that we will use all over this project is object oriented approach. It is \\na new  system development approach, encouraging and facilitating re -use of software \\ncomponents.  There  are three  types  of Object  Oriente d Methodologies,  \\n                I. Object  Modeling  Techniques  (OMT)  \\nIt was one of the first object oriented methodologies and was introduced by \\nRumbaugh in  1991.OMT uses three different models that are combined in a way \\nthat is analogous to the  older  structured methodologies.  \\nOMT  Models  can be distinguished  as: \\na. Object  Model : It depicts the object classes and their relationships as a class diagram, which \\nrepresents the  static structure of the system. It observes all the objects as static and does not \\npay a ny attention  to their dynamic  nature.  \\nb. Dynamic  Model : It captures the behavior of the system over time and the flow control and \\nevents in the Event - Trace Diagrams  and State  Transition  Diagrams.  It portrays  the changes  \\noccurring in  the states  of various ob jects  with the  events that  might occur in the  system.  \\nc. Functional  Model :It describes the data transformations of the system. It describes the flow of \\ndata and the  changes  that occur to the  data throughout the  system.  \\nII.

Overview  \\n \\nThese chapters mainly deal with object oriented analysis of the business area in terms \\nof the  new system to be developed by the team analysis.  Actors who interact with the \\nsystem are  identified in the business rules applied to the business process. A user \\ninterface prototype, use  case diagrams, and  sequence  diagrams,  in that  order, have all \\ncaptured  these  aspects.  \\n \\n3.2. Use case  modelin g \\n \\nA use -case model is a model of how different types of users interact with the system \\nto solve  a problem. As such, it describes the goals of the users, the interactions \\nbetween the users and  the system, and the required behavior of the system in \\nsatisfyi ng these goals.

The use case model we used consists of: a \\nuse case diagram, a set of use  case descriptions, a set of actor descriptions, user \\ninterface identification and a set of  scenario s (described by  flow of  events).  \\nOur use case diagram uses four concepts to graphically model the problem domain: \\nuse case,  actor,  relationship link and boundary.  \\n\\uf06c Use case : an ellipse marked  with the  name of  the use  case.

       " Document(page_content=\"1 \\n CHAPTER 5  \\nOBJECT ORIENTED DESIGN  \\n5.1 Introduction  \\nA software design process known as object -oriented design (OOD) concentrates on modeling a system as a group \\nof objects that  interact with one another to carry out tasks. The basic building blocks of OOD are called objects, \\nand each object includes properties and methods that describe its state and its actions, respectively.Making \\nsoftware that is simple to comprehend, maintain , and extend is OOD's major objective. OOD helps developers to \\nwrite modular, reusable code that is simple to modify and adapt to changing requirements by breaking down a \\nsystem into smaller, more manageable objects.  \\nThe advent of the object -oriented parad igm brought data and methods together into a reusable blueprint. Object is \\na class that defines the attributes (variables) and behaviors (methods) of that object. Using object -oriented design \\nleads to code that is more maintainable, reusable, and adaptable , and is therefore a popular approach in modern \\nsoftware development. In this chapter, we addressed the major Object Oriented Design artifacts, such as class type \\narchitecture, class modeling, collaboration modeling, component modeling, deployment modeling , user interface \\ndesign, and other design artifacts, in order to bridge the gap between analysis and implementation.  \\n5.2 System Architecture  \\nWe used an architecture called MVC (Model View Controller).Model -View -Controller (MVC) is a software \\narchitecture p attern commonly used for creating user interfaces that divides an application into three \\ninterconnected components  the model (data), the view (user interface), and the controller (processes that handle \\ninput). The main benefit of using MVC is that it help s to create loosely coupled and modular code, which is easier \\nto maintain and update. MVC separates the business logic and presentation layer from each other . \\nThe model  \\nThe Model represents the business logic and data of an application, such as the data us ed by the application or the \\nrules and processes that operate on that data. It receives user input from the controller; the view renders the \\nmodel's presentation in a specific format; and model code usually represents real -world objects. However, it \\nshould  be noted that the model is unaware of the source of the data or the method by which it is acquired.\", metadata={'source': '../data/Final Askuala1$2.pdf', 'page': 85}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='2 \\n  \\nView  \\nThe View represents the presentation layer of the application, such as the graphical user interface that users \\ninteract with to view and modify data . The View describes in detail what is shown to the user. Most of the time, \\ncontrollers pass data to every view for rendering in some manner. Views are another method of gathering user \\ndata.  \\nController  \\nThe Controller acts as an intermediary between the Mo del and the View and is responsible for controlling the \\nflow of data between them. The Controller may specify the procedures for adding tasks and designating others as \\ncomplete. The controller is responsible for responding to the user input and performs in teractions on the data \\nmodel objects. The controller receives the input; it validates the input and then performs the business operation \\nthat modifies the state of the data model.  \\nList of models  \\n\\uf0b7 Student  \\n\\uf0b7 Instructor  \\n\\uf0b7 Coordinator  \\n\\uf0b7 System Administrator  \\n\\uf0b7 User Acc ount \\n\\uf0b7 course  \\n\\uf0b7 Class  \\n\\uf0b7 Grade  \\nList of View  \\n\\uf0b7 Login Page  \\n\\uf0b7 Home Page  \\n\\uf0b7 Feedback page  \\n\\uf0b7 Grade Report  \\n\\uf0b7 Assessment  \\n\\uf0b7 Profile  \\n\\uf0b7 Material list', metadata={'source': '../data/Final Askuala1$2.pdf', 'page': 86}),\n",

Instead  of \\nusing  tables  and rows  as in the traditional  relational  databases,  Mongo DB makes  use of collections \\nand documents. Documents consist of key -value pairs which are the  basic  unit of data in \\nMongoDB.  Collections  contain  sets of documents  and function  which  is the equivalent of \\nrelational database  tables.  \\n6.2 Testing and testing p rocedures  \\nThis chapter deals with testing and testing procedures used in this project. Testing in software \\ndevelopment is the process of evaluating a software application or system to identify defects, \\nerrors, or bugs that may affect its functionality, per formance, or usability. Testing is an essential \\npart of the software development lifecycle, and it helps to ensure that the final product meets the \\nrequirements and expectations of the users. (Pressman, 2014) There are many different types of \\ntesting that can be used in software development, including unit testing, integration testing, \\nsystem testing, acceptance testing, and regression testing. Each type of testing focuses on a \\nspecific aspect of the software application or system and uses different techniq ues and tools to \\nevaluate its performance and functionality. In this section we will Unit testing, Integration testing \\nand System t esting  \\n6.2.1 Unit Testing  \\nUnit testing is a type of testing procedure which tries to find faults in participating objects and  \\nsubsystems with respect to the use case from the use case model.(Hoffer,1999).It is a type of \\ntesting that focuses on individual components or modules of the software application.  \\nIn order to confirm and validate that each module of our system is ready fo r usage, we conducted \\nthis testing prior to using any other testing methodologies. This testing's goal is to ensure that \\neach component is operating as it should. The project team modules the system since unit testing \\nnecessitates breaking the entire syste m down into individual modules. Each unit tested and \\nfounded to be working as intended in implemented system .\", metadata={'source': '../data/Final Askuala1$2.pdf', 'page': 107}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='24 \\n 6.2.2   Integration Testing  \\nIntegration Testing is a type of  software  testing  in which the different units, modules or \\ncomponents of a software application are tested as a combined entity.  \\nEven when each module of the application is unit -tested, some errors may still exist. To identify \\nthese errors and ensure that the mod ules work well together after integration, integration testing is \\ncrucial.  \\nIn this phase software modules are combined and tested as a group. Integration testing is conducted \\nto evaluate the  compliance  of a system or component with specified  functional requirements . It \\noccurs after  unit testing  and before  system testing . Integration testing takes as its \\ninput  modules  that have been unit tested, groups them in larger aggregates, applies tests defined in \\nan integration  test plan  to those aggregates, and del ivers as its output the integrated system ready \\nfor system testing . \\nIn this project Integration testing is gradual. First we test the coordinating module and only one of \\nits subordinate modules. After the first test, we add one or two other subordinate modules from the \\nsame level. Once the program has been tested with the coordinating module and all of its \\nimmediately subordinate modules, we add modules from the next level and then test the progra m. \\nWe continue this procedure until the entire program has been tested as a unit.  \\n6.2.3 System Testing   \\nSystem Testing  is a level of testing that validates the complete and fully integrated software \\nproduct. The purpose of a system test is to evaluate the end-to-end system specifications. Usually, \\nthe software is only one element of a larger computer -based system. Ultimately, the software is \\ninterfaced with other software/hardware systems. System Testing is defined as a series of different \\ntests whose sole purpose is to exercise the full computer -based system.  \\nSystem Testing is Blackbox  \\nTwo Category of Software Testing  \\n\\uf0b7 Black Box Testing  \\n\\uf0b7 White Box Testing  \\nSystem test falls under the  black box testing  category of software testing.', metadata={'source': '../data/Final Askuala1$2.pdf', 'page': 108}),\n",

Deployment and Installation process  \\nSoftware deployment is the process of making software avail able for use on a system by users and \\nother programs. Software deployment involves all the activities required to get a software system \\nor application ready for use on a device or a server.  \\nSoftware deployment process typically includes activities such as  provisioning environments, \\ninstalling and testing new applications, and deploying updates or patches to add new functionality \\nor address bugs, vulnerabilities, or performance issues.  \\nThe software deployment process consists of several interrelated activit ies. These activities \\ngenerally include provisioning environments (preparing the necessary resources for software to \\nrun, such as servers, databases, and network configurations), installing software, comprehensive \\ntesting, monitoring system health and perf ormance, and potentially rolling back deployments.  \\nWe used 5 stages of software deployment which includes planning, design, test, schedule and \\ndeploy.  \\ni.Planning  \\nThe first stage in a software deployment process is to make a plan.

Developers may run a set of scripts to update \\nrelevant databases before changes can go live.  \\nFinally, another additional installation process is providing documentation.

During the design and \\ndevelopment of this system, we discovered two big opportunities that have the potential to \\nsignificantly improve the system. A one -to-one chat, wherein the system user can talk with a \\nspecific p erson, is recommended. An examination system that enables teachers upload exams and \\nstudents can answer on it and see their result, is the second modification that can be made to the \\nsystem. The two recommendations above are recommended and encouraged for individuals who \\ndesire to improve the system further.\", metadata={'source': '../data/Final Askuala1$2.pdf', 'page': 112}),\n",
