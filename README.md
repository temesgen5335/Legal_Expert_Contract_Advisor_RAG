# Contract Advisor RAG
Build and Evaluate A High-Precision Legal Expert LLM APP

## Overview

This project aims to develop a high-precision legal expert system for contract Q&A using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The system leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to provide accurate and context-aware answers to questions about legal contracts and integrates a powerful language model with a custom retrieval mechanism to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers to contract-related queries.
